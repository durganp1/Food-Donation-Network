                <p class="pure-u-1-1">The Donation Network was founded with the goal of creating and connecting a network of Food Service Providers with Charities in their local area.  According to Foodprint.org, US restaurants produce an estimated 22-33 billion pounds of food waste each year.  After decades in the food industry, I have seen this waste personally.  At the same time HUD estimatesthat there are 553,742 people that are homeless each night and without food.  This figure does not include the 14.3 million households who are considered food insecure (USDA).At the end of each day, Food Service Providers throw out pounds and pounds of left over and unused food.  This food is perfectly fine for consumption but would not be up to the food service providers freshness standards by the next day.  This is where the Donation Network can provide assistance.The Donation Network will allow both Food Service Providers and Charities to search for each other within their local area.  This can help facilitate networking relationships between the two organizations to allow the left-over food to make its way to the people who need it the most.</p>
